# RustyController

A simple project to play with some LEDs :)

[Repo](https://github.com/LegendL3n/RustyController-plugins) with the "plugins" of this project. (basically consumers of the API)

## Motivation

I started this project because I wanted to learn Rust, but didn't have any use for it.

However... I could play with PsMove's LED!

I've used [C++ in the past](https://github.com/LegendL3n/MembroEsquerdo), to interact with them, but C++ is a pain...

## Acknowledge

I've made use of [psmoveapi's](https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi) source, to know how to interact with the controller using HIDAPI, and its request structures.
