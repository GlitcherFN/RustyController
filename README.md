# RustyController

A simple project to play with some LEDs :)

## Motivation

I started this project because I wanted to learn Rust, but didn't have any use for it.

But... I wanted to play with PsMove's LED!

I've used [C++ in the past](https://github.com/LegendL3n/MembroEsquerdo), to interact with them, but C++ is a pain...

## Acknowledge

I've read the source of [psmoveapi](https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi), to know how to find the controller with HIDAPI, and the request structures.
